        segments in the fracture network.

    length : array-like
        The length of each segment.

        The thickness of each segment, the dimension orthogonal to the fracture
        network.

        The fracture width or aperture.

    Attributes
    ----------
    n_segments : int

        """Calculate the mass flow throughout the fracture network.

        The mass flow is calculated by first finding the pressure at each node.
        The flow through each segment is equal to the pressure change times
        the conductance. The pressure change is defined as outlet minus inlet
        pressure value of the segment, where the outlet node is the second node
        in defining the segment's connectivity. Note, that negative values of
        mass flow are a result of a reverse of the specified inlet and outlet
        nodes. For example, if a segment's nodes are (0, 1) and has a negative
        mass flow, then the correct ordering is (1, 0).

        ----------
        fluid : dfn.Fluid
            Fluid object containing the fluid's properties.

        essential_bc : dict
            Dictionary of node index to pressure at node for all essential
            (Dirichlet) boundary conditions.

        point_sources : dict
            Dictionary of node index to mass rate loss or gain for all point
            sources in the system. Negative values indicate that mass is
            removed from the system; positive values indicate that mass is
            injected.
